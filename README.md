# Selective Detection
The goal of the project is to test Selective Detection - a model ensemble structure based on YOLO to detect adversarial attacks. The ensemble compares output of each checkpoint created during training with neighbouring checkpoints and with final model, and decides whether the image is attacked or not, and displays the image only if it is confident in predictions. To view how the model works visit [this notebook](https://github.com/davidkhachikov/selective-yolo/blob/main/notebooks/selective-detection-hypo-test.ipynb). Do not launch the code cells after "for Kaggle only"comments if you are not on Kaggle.
